            <h2>About The Game</h2>
            <p>
                SIGNALIS is a survival horror game developed by Rose‐Engine. It combines classic survival horror
                gameplay with a unique aesthetic and narrative.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                More information can be found on the <a href="https://rose-engine.org/signalis/" target="_blank">official website</a>
                The game was released on 27th October 2022. It is available on <span style="color:#FF0000;">PC, Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</span>. 
                I strongly recommend playing it if you a fan of classic survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill, or fan
                of retro aesthetics and anime.

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This is a community‐driven artbook celebrating the game SIGNALIS.
                It is a <span style="color:#FF0000;">non‐commercial fan project</span> and is not affilated with Rose-Engine.
                This artbook serves as a platform for artists to showcase their work inspired by SIGNALIS.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Each piece reflects a personal connection: <span style="color:#FF0000;">what the game meant to us</span>, how we interpreted it, and how we chose to express that through art.

                It is more than just an album of art, but with artist interpretations of the game, it is a collection of memories and experiences shared by the community,
                as well as what brought the artist to create their art.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I hope everyone who contributed to this project, as well as those who read it, will find something that resonates with them.

            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <h3>Why is this book special?</h3>
            <p>
                This handcrafted artbook is designed to look like and in-universe user manual for the game SIGNALIS.
                Main inspiration for the design is the in-game UI, as well as older game user manuals and artbooks like the Homeworld technical manual.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>What is in this book?</h3>
            <p>
                The book feature pages that are designed to matches the aesthetic of the game.
                Each artist is to feature their SIGNALIS fanart in this book, together with a monochrome, bakemonogatari-style that describes who they are, with a short description of their art and what it means to them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Where can I get this book?</h3>
            <p>

                The book will also be published online across various platforms in digital format for free, likely on my social media.
            </p>
            <br />

                <span style="color:#FF0000;">All collaborators will receive a free physical copy of the book.</span>
