                Combat series and arcade combat flight game
                as a whole.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Project Wingman : Frontline 59 is a expansion pack of Project Wingman with 6 addtional missions.</p>
            <br />

                The game was released on 1st December 2020. The game was initially released on 1st December 2020 and is available on <span style="color:#e6632c;">PC, Xbox
                    One, PS5 and VR platform.</span>.

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond the adrenaline-pumping aerial combat, Project Wingman's evocative world-building, intricate lore, and compelling narrative
                delivered via the excelltently well written radio chatter and dialog. As well as a handcrafted, unqiue world building that I found extremely interesting. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>I have been creating fan art of the game and was surprised by how much the community loved them. So
                instead of simply publishng my art online. I want to
                do something extra and create an artbook for them. Further expanding the world of Project Wingman for the community.</p>
            <br />
            <p> This project, titled UNSANCTIONED SKIES, is a  <span style="color:#e6632c;">non‐commercial fan project</span> and is not affilated with Sector
                D2.
                I have obtained official permission in the creation of this book and will publish it both online and
                physical. All rights are reserve to Sector D2 and no-in game
                assets were used directly. Sector D2 would reserve the rights to cease the production or distribution of
                this book if requested.</p>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My vision for this book is to immerse readers within the game's universe, presenting it as a collection of in-universe military documents and geo-political analyses. 
                This approach is deeply inspired by classic game manuals, such as the Homeworld Manual, which seamlessly integrated lore into their design. 
                My aim is to expand upon the established world of Project Wingman and the enigmatic Sicario PMC, filling narrative gaps and weaving new stories through original lore and my artistic interpretation.
            </p>

            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <h3>What is in this book?</h3>
            <p>
                The book will feature original art pieces depicting all 21 main missions and the 6 Frontline 59 DLC missions, 
                offering perspectives beyond that of Hitman 1 Monarch, the player character. 
                Each artwork will be accompanied by extensive writing, providing my unique interpretation and imaginative expansion of the Project Wingman universe.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                For the Frontline 59 missions, a separate, more concise After Action Report-style booklet will be released, detailing the actions of Reserve Division K-9A.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The overarching narrative will be presented from the viewpoint of a research institute  investigating and tracking Sicario's operations throughout the Cascadian Conflict. 
                The book will also include detailed supplementary sections on Sicario PMC itself, covering its force composition, ORBAT and operational maps.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Where can I get this book?</h3>
            <p>
                Once the book is completed, it will be available for <span style="color:#e6632c;">free</span> as a PDF.
                The book will also be published online across various platforms in digital format for free, likely on my
                social media.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                A small number of physical copies will be available for sales as well if I am able to secure a booth
                space at C107 Winter Comiket 2025, Tokyo, Japan.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                All proceeds from the sales will be used to cover printing costs for the book, transportation, booth
                space and other related costs are covered by me personally.
            <br />
            <h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
            <p>
                Compare to my project on <a href="https://mikecraftz.github.io/signalis_community_artbook_site/"
                    target="_blank">Signalis</a>. This book is more like a real
                "book". I cannot just randomly put other’s artwork into it or it will become a 100 pages art albumn. I
                aim to maintain a serious and consistent thematic tone. As such,  general artwork contributions cannot be directly integrated.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                However, I am actively seeking specific contributions for specialised elements, such as detailed operational maps, 
                authentic unit insignia for CIF/PMC factions, or lore pieces that align perfectly with the book's narrative 
                and aesthetic. If you possess skills in these areas (e.g., map design templates from PW role-playing communities, custom unit insignia), and believe you can help elevate this project, 
                please reach out via the contact information below.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>Do you take money? Can I buy this book?</h3>
            <p>
                This entire project, including any commissions I request and the physical printing, is funded entirely out of my own pocket. 
                My goal is to keep this project strictly non-profit to avoid any potential issues with publishers or developers. If you wish to support my work and help spread awareness of this art book, 
                please consider sharing this project with others or donating via my <a href="http://ko-fi.com/amanettc"
