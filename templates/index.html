                Combat series and arcade combat flight game
                as a whole.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Project Wingman : Frontline 59 is a expansion pack of Project Wingman with 6 addtional missions.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                More information can be found on the <a
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/895870/Project_Wingman//" target="_blank">steam page</a>
                The game was released on 1st December 2020. It is available on <span style="color:#FF0000;">PC, Xbox
                    One, PS5 and VR platform.</span>.

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The game itself is an excellet flight combat sim that give player that thrill on dog fighting with enemy
                aircrafts. But the thing that interested me
                the most is the spectacle and writing of the game. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Its narrates the world, settings and story of people in the world simple via radio chatter. And the
                missions of the game are hand crafted to give an spectacula visual treat to me.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I have been creating fan art of the game and was surprised by how much the community loved them. So
                instead of simply publishng my art online. I want to
                do something extra and create an artbook for them.</p>
            <br />
            <p>It is a <span style="color:#FF0000;">non‐commercial fan project</span> and is not affilated with Sector
                D2.
                I have obtained official permission in the creation of this book and will publish it both online and
                physical. All rights are reserve to Sector D2 and no-in game
                assets were used directly. Sector D2 would resever the rights to cease the production or distribution of
                this book if requested.</p>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The book will pretends itself to be a in-universe military documents/geo-political analysis. The main
                insipration is the old Homeworld Manual, I really like games that takes itself seriously and have player
                manual that looks like something existed in-universe.
                I will write and come up with story about the world in my own imagenation, filling in the gaps of the
                world of Project Wingman and Sicario PMC itself.
            </p>

            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <h3>What is in this book?</h3>
            <p>
                The book would present art pieces that depicts all 21+6 DLC missions from pov outside of Hitman 1
                Monarch, the player characters.
                All art pieces would include writing about the missions itself in my own imagenationand interpretation
                on the world of Project Wingman.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                For F59 missions, a shorter, After Action Report like book will be released separated that depict the
                actions of Reserver Division K-9.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The writing will be from a point of view of a research institute researching and tracking the actiosn of
                Sicario over the course of Cascadian Conflict.
                I will also write short paragraphs on Sicario itself, like its force composition, ORBAT and operational
                map.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Where can I get this book?</h3>
            <p>
                Once the book is completed, it will be available for <span style="color:#FF0000;">free</span> as a PDF.
                The book will also be published online across various platforms in digital format for free, likely on my
                social media.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <span style="color:#FF0000;">All collaborators will receive a free physical copy of the book.</span>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                A small number of physical copies will be available for sales as well if I am able to secure a booth
                space at C107 Winter Comiket 2025, Tokyo, Japan.
                Any one participated the book as collaborator will be given a physical copy of the book for free.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                All proceeds from the sales will be used to cover printing costs for the book, transportation, booth
                space and other related costs are covered by me personally.
                However per rose-engine's policies , no online sales of the physical print will be made available, and
                the print will be a one-off print run.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
            <p>
                Compare to my project on <a href="https://mikecraftz.github.io/signalis_community_artbook_site/"
                    target="_blank">Signalis</a>. This book is more like a real
                "book". I cannot just randomly put other’s artwork into it or it will become a 100 pages art albumn. I
                want to keep the serious and thesis like theme of the book.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                However I do have people reach out to me, and I reaching out to people on creating specfic art,
                operational map or unit insiginia. Which aligns with some very specfic
                use case of the book. For example I don't know how to make maps and some folks reached out to give me
                png templates of map they used for PW role play. Or people who make
                unit insiginia for units in CIF/PMC.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>

            <h3>Do you take money? Can I buy this book?</h3>
            <p>
                The project itself, any commision I requested and the actual printing of the book are all pay out of my
                own pocket. I wish to keep this project
                as non-profit to avoid publisher/developer issues.
